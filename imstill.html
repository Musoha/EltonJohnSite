        "I'm Still Standing" is a song written by English musician Elton John and songwriter Bernie Taupin, from John's 1983 studio album Too Low for Zero.[3] It was the lead single from the album in North America, but released as the second single in the UK.

Helped by a video promoting the song on MTV, "I'm Still Standing" became a big hit for John on both sides of the Atlantic, peaking at No. 1 in Canada[4] and Switzerland,[5] No. 4 in the UK[6] and No. 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100.[7]

    You could never know what it's like
    Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
    And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
    You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
    And did you think this fool could never win?
    Well, look at me, I'm a-comin' back again
    I got a taste of love in a simple way
    And if you need to know while I'm still standin'x`
    You just fade away

    Don't you know I'm still standin' better than I ever did?
    Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid
    And I'm still standin' after all this time
    Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

    I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
    I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

    Once, I never coulda hoped to win
    You're startin' down the road, leavin' me again
    The threats you made were meant to cut me down
    And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

    You know I'm still standin' better than I ever did
    Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid
    And I'm still standin' after all this time
    Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

    I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
    I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

    Don't you know that I'm still standin' better than I ever did?
