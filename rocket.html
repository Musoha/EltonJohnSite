<pre style="font-size: 16px;">

    She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
    Zero hour, 9 a.m.
    And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
    I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
    It's lonely out in space
    On such a timeless flight

    And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
    'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
    I'm not the man they think I am at home
    Oh, no, no, no
    I'm a rocket man
    Rocket man
    Burning out his fuse up here alone

    And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
    'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
    I'm not the man they think I am at home
    Oh, no, no, no
    I'm a rocket man
    Rocket man
    Burning out his fuse up here alone

    Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
    In fact, it's cold as hell
    And there's no one there to raise them if you did
    And all the science, I don't understand
    It's just my job five days a week
    A rocket man
    A rocket man

    And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
    'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
    I'm not the man they think I am at home
    Oh, no, no, no
    I'm a rocket man
    Rocket man
    Burning out his fuse up here alone

    And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
    'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
    I'm not the man they think I am at home
    Oh, no, no, no
    I'm a rocket man
    Rocket man
    Burning out his fuse up here alone

    And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
    And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
    And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
    And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
    And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
    And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
    And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
    And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
    Oh, I think it's gonna be a long, long time
