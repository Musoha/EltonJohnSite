        Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is the seventh studio album by English singer, pianist, and composer Elton John, first released on 5 October 1973 as a double album by DJM Records. 
        Recorded at the Studio d'enregistrement Michel Magne at the Château d'Hérouville in France, the album became a double LP once John and his band became inspired by the locale.
        Among the 17 tracks, the album contains the hits "Candle in the Wind," US number-one single "Bennie and the Jets," "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" and "Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting", along with the live favourite "Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding."

<pre style="font-size: 16px;">

    When are you gonna come down?
    When are you going to land?
    I should have stayed on the farm
    I should have listened to my old man

    You know you can't hold me forever
    I didn't sign up with you
    I'm not a present for your friends to open
    This boy's too young to be singing
    The blues, ah, ah

    So goodbye yellow brick road
    Where the dogs of society howl
    You can't plant me in your penthouse
    I'm going back to my plough

    Back to the howling old owl in the woods
    Hunting the horny back toad
    Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
    Beyond the yellow brick road
    Ah, ah

    What do you think you'll do then?
    I bet they'll shoot down the plane
    It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
    To set you on your feet again

    Maybe you'll get a replacement
    There's plenty like me to be found
    Mongrels who ain't got a penny
    Sniffing for tidbits like you
    On the ground, ah, ah

    So goodbye yellow brick road
    Where the dogs of society howl
    You can't plant me in your penthouse
    I'm going back to my plough

    Back to the howling old owl in the woods
    Hunting the horny back toad
    Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
    Beyond the yellow brick road
    Ah, ah
